We propose a method to generate negative samples of the program.

We propose an innovative framework TimeDA, which alleviates the problem of reduced accuracy of Deep Learning (DL)-based source code authorship attribution due to time evolution by adding new feature extractors to the original DL-based code attribution framework to enhance the original model's ability to learn source domain features without requiring new or more source data. Moreover, we employ a centroid-based pseudo-labeling strategy using neighborhood clustering entropy for adaptive learning to improve the robustness of DL-based code authorship attribution.

We use two time-segmented datasets for evaluation, both of which are introduced in our work.
- (1) Java
- (2) C++
